		Global Offensive has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, as well as allowing members of the community to host their own servers with custom maps and game modes. Global Offensive has a competitive scene, with Valve-sponsored tournaments being the premier competitive events for the game. Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics. The game was praised for its overall gameplay and faithfulness to the previous iterations in the series. Some of the early features were criticized, and while the console versions received positive reviews, reviewers believed there were obvious differences between the console and PC versions of the game</h2>

					<h4>The Counter Strike Global:Offensive</h4>
					<p>Here you can see a terrorist running with the C4(bomb) from the Counter-Terrorist Team. Entering Bombsite B for Terrorists can be more difficult to enter due to the long hallway of the B apartments. Using flashes can stop a player at van and anyone else in Bombsite B. Sometimes teams will take mid control and enter through short B and B apartments leaving a player in ladder room to cut off rotates. </p>
