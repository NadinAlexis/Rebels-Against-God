			       <h1>CHAMPIONS !!</h1>
				   <p>As I said from before there are many champions in League of Legends there are almost 140 champions to choose from and more are coming in the league.
				   Classified into their classes you may pick what role you want and pick what suits you the most. The Summoner's Rift which is the place
				   where you will fight is divided into four parts. The top lane, mid lane, bottom lane and the jungle. You may pick your position in any of those 
				   places which I have set. There are champions specified for those lanes. We Have Different Classes in Champions classifying It one by one will take all 
				   your time so I will not tell them all.For no champion in the league is stuck on the same role depending on your choice and skills you can make infite possibilities
				   to every different champions.</p>

				    <h1>NEW SKINS !</h1>
					<p>The thing that I really love about League of Legends Is that every major event where they will release a skin It has its own music video.
					It just blows my mind that they make an effort in skins which are not just good in the game but you can enjoy them in their video too. It is like double
					the Fun in the game or just searching in the internet. Especially this new skin line which rocked the world, The world was still not ready for this as the K/DA are here.
 					kyahhhhh even though im not a real fan of K-POP this song is very lit. Anyone can enjoy It. With the combination of the very artistic music video plus the great characters.
					K/DA mess me up litterally earning 13 million views upon their release in just 3 days and such smooth graphic in the game.
					Even though you may say that its for money you gatta respect the effort and their determination
					to accomplish such tasks just for a skin in the game. LOVE YOU RIOT !!</p>

				   <p>In Your own gaming you rise through the ranks starting from Unranked to "Iron" until the hardest rank "Challenger".Even I am still In
				   Platinum rank which im really proud off. But to Make your name and team a Legend you must rise and win in the proffesional gaming world
				   of the League.This Year of Worlds is not a World that I really loved because just last year my Idol FAKER of SKT T1 a Real Legend but sadly lost in
				   the tournament and cried.As they say Legends never Die and the game goes on and on in which here on the new worlds arises new stars and team trying
				   to make a name for themselves.You may LOSE but at least try fight it. A tournament full of surprises and hardwork and unity of the teams.
				   Will you just stay around and die or Rise up and Face your Fate.It doesnt matter If you are an amateur or a Pro all are Welcome in Esports just prove yourself and Rise.
				   And your passion for gaming will lead you there. FAKER WILL RETURN IN 2019 JUST WAIT FOR IT GUYS HAHAHAHAHA !!</p>
