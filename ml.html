		<h1>ADDICTIVE YET ENJOYABLE GAME</h1>
		<p>We, the players of mobile legends:bang bang promotes humility and integrity. This online game can also create a fresh and newly circle of friends. In this created group, we can observe teamwork and coordination.
		This online game is different from other online games because you can play wherever you want, just be sure to have a strong internet connection because this game is played on mobile phones. 
		In this game we have a seven rank: warrior, elite, master, grandmaster, epic, legend and mythic. We also have different game modes like classic, brawl, A.I, custom, mirror mode, frenzy mode, mayhem mode, survival mode and practice mode
		My account named Wei09 is on epic division. It is really hard to rank up because of the hard headed teammates specially when you are a solo player. The only way to level up is to adjust and to have patience on your teammates. Do not argue with them if possible.
		So what are you waiting for? Download the application and start doing your google account. This will help you to secure your account and prevent it from losing.</p>
